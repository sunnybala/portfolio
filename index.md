[AI Speech Synthesis for Dubbing](pages/sample_page2)

Neural networks have been shown as being effective for cloning voices given speech data (ex. creating fake speeches by politicians). Recent multi-speaker networks work in the space of vocal characteristics and therefore no longer require training for each speaker individually. Here, I applied one such network to automatically dub an episode of a Japanese reality show (Terrace House) into English.

### 2019

Used an e-ink panel and a raspberry pi zero in a 3D printed case to mimic the similar device on the platform. It used the MTA API in order to grab the train times and let me glance up and see any train delays without getting stuck on the platform.

[Spherical Cucumber](http://example.com/)

Inspired by the Japanese square watermelon which is created by growing into a special mold, I thought it would be fun to learn more about CAD + 3D Printing by applying a similar idea to cucumbers. I grew cucumbers in my apartment and designed a special mold to try and force them into a spherical shape. Unfortunately I didn’t succeed – they just bent.

[Etch-a-Sketch Robot](http://example.com/)
Connected motors to the knob of an etch-a-sketch and used a graph based algorithm to translate images into something reproducible on screen.

[Elevator Awkwardness Minimizer](http://example.com/)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

For a period of time we could not use the stairs and had to take the elevator in the office. This led to cramped conditions. Here, I simulated different numbers of agents within the confines of an elevator that tried to maximize their distance with each other. The result of this was a series of recommendations around where to stand given N people in the elevator.
