## VR Conducting Game

**Quick Look:** As an early adopter of the HTC Vive, I was amazed by the possibilities. For this project I learned how to use the Unity game engine and designed a game to conduct a virtual orchestra. I used MIDI files to get the scores across instruments then allowed the player to control the tempo, volume, and cue-ing individual instruments to come in.
